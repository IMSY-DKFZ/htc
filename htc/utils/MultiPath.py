    This class can be used as an substitute for Path objects. It offers the possibility to have multiple root paths defined. If a new path is constructed and used, all alternatives are checked and the first which exists is used. This works best if relative file paths are unique across all alternatives.

    >>> path = MultiPath('/a/b')  # This path does not exist
    >>> path.add_alternative('/home')  # This path does exist
    >>> str(path)  # Print the string representation of the path which exists
    '/home'
    >>> path.name
    'home'

    For read operations, the path can be used as-is without further considerations. It will go over all locations and return the first one which exist.

    For write operations, the situation is a bit more complex, however. In principle, you also write to the best match, e.g. an existing location. However, you may want to explicitly write to a specific directory. For this, you need to make sure that you have a needle set. Then, you can either construct your path and mkdir your folders in which case a matching needle will always be used even if the match does not exist or explicitly construct your path and resolve it via `find_best_location(writing=True)`. Usually, the mkdir approach is sufficient.
