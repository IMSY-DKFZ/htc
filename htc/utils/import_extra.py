    Decorator which can be used to specify that a function needs an extra library which is not installed by default (the user has to install it via `pip install imsy-htc[extra]`).

    The general pattern is to import the library at the top in a try block:
    ```python
    try:
        from challenger_pydocker import ChallengeR

        _missing_library = ""
    except ImportError:
        _missing_library = "challenger_pydocker"

    @requires_extra(_missing_library)
    def my_function():
        pass
    ```

    Args:
        missing_library: Name of the library which is missing or empty string if the library is present.
