    Tries to bring some consistency to paths:
        - Resolve home directories (~ â†’ /home/username).
        - Make paths absolute.

    Note: this requires access to the filesystem and when the path points to a high-latency location, then this may introduce a lag.

    Args:
        path: The original path.

    Returns:
        The unified path.
