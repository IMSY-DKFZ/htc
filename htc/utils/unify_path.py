    Tries to bring some consistency to paths:
        - Resolve home directories (~ â†’ /home/username).
        - Make paths absolute.
        - Resolves symbolic links (optional).

    Note: this requires access to the filesystem and when the path points to a high-latency location, then this may introduce a lag.

    Args:
        path: The original path.
        resolve_symlinks: If true, also resolve symbolic links.

    Returns: The unified path.
