    "# Median Spectra\n",
    "It is very common for spectral data to reduce the complexity by performing an analysis based on median spectra first. Media spectra are computed per image an annotated region and are computed by calculating the median per channel across all values of the annotated region. For the HSI data of the HeiPorSPECTRAL dataset, this yields a 100-dimensional vector per image and annotated region. Since those vectors are commonly needed, they are precomputed for each dataset for easy access and its usage is shown here."
