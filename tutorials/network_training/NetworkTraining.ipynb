    "# Training a Network\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the task of training a segmentation network within the htc framework. This is a complex task and a full training setup with all the details would be too much for a single tutorial. Hence, we consider an artificial simple example of segmenting only heart and lung in images from all annotators and we also don't use the full dataset but only a reduced version to keep the training time short.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we need the following components to solve this training task:\n",
    "- Data specification which defines our training setup (folds and splits).\n",
    "- A lightning class where we define the model and our training/validation.\n",
    "- A configuration file with all our training settings.\n",
    "- Training of the network.\n",
    "- Aggregating the fold results and visualizing the results.\n",
    "- At the very end of our experiments: compute the results on the (untouched) test set."

    "## Data Specification\n",
    "The data specification is a fundamental concept and is required for any training task. Here you define which images should be loaded in which fold/split. Since we deal with hierarchical data (multiple images per subject), we usually make cuts on the subject and not on the image level, i.e. we put all  images from the same subject into one split.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep it simple, we use only 2 folds with three splits each (train, validation and test). We will use images from 3 pigs in total. For the generation of the specs file, we can use the `SpecsGeneration` class and here we only need to overwrite the `generate_folds()` method which returns a list of dicts with each dict defining one fold."

    "When you exectue the above cell, a JSON file will be created in the folder of this notebook. This file defines our two folds and the subject which is used for training (`P093` in the first and `P094` in the second fold) and validation (`P094` in the first and `P093` in the second fold). For each split, we simply list the images which belong to this split. `P095` is used as test set for all folds The test set must remain untouched until all experiments are complete and we are happy with the performance on the validation set. Only then is it time to take a look at the test set.\n",

    "## Lightning Class\n",
    "The lightning class defines our training based on a batch of images, i.e. the model we want to use, the computation of the loss or the validation of images. This is based on the [Lightning framework](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) with some additional extensions for our data. In our task, we want to predict segmentation masks on full images, so we can re-use a lot of the existing [`LightningImage`](../../htc/models/image/LightningImage.py) class which, for example, already computes the dice loss during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, in our own class, we inherit form [`LightningImage`](../../htc/models/image/LightningImage.py) and just overwrite the parts which we want to change.  For showcase purposes, we overwrite the `training_step()` method and add the [focal loss](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/losses.html#focalloss) as additional loss (additional to the dice and cross entropy loss) for our training. In similar ways, you can basically overwrite any methods and adapt the training to your needs. You can find the class [`LightningImageThoracic`](LightningImageThoracic.py) in the same folder as this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that we also did not overwrite any validation or test methods (e.g. `validation_step()`). This is because LightningImage already inherits from [`EvaluationMixin`](../../htc/models/common/EvaluationMixin.py) which computes some default metrics like the dice score useful for segmentation tasks as ours."

    "## Training Configuration\n",
    "The specification of your training is summarized in a configuration file. In the htc framework, we are using simple JSON files for this purpose. Here you define which data you want to use, the augmentations, etc. To make it simple, we inherit from the default configuration of the image model and just adapt the parts we need. These are:\n",
    "- Which lightning class do we want to use?\n",
    "- On which data do we want to train? (i.e. which specs file to use)\n",
    "- Which annotations to load?\n",
    "- How do we want to aggregate the metric scores? On the class-level or on the image-level? In the pretrained networks, we aggregated on the image-level yielding one score per subject. This makes only sense if the complete image is annotated and you want to know the segmentation performance for an image. Here, however, we do not have fully-segmented images, so an image-level score is less meaningful. Instead, we want to look at the class-level scores yielding a metric score per organ.\n",

    "## Aggregating and Visualizing\n",
    "After we trained our network, we would like to know wheter it performs well. You could have visualized the metric scores with TensorBoard but this is only a single view on a single fold. What we want is a holistic view on our network performance. This includes aggregation across folds and correctly aggregating with respect to the hierarchy in the data. The later is easy to miss: we cannot simply average our performance scores across all images as the number of images per subject is not always the same (even not in our standardized dataset). What is more, images from one subject are not independent from each other leading to common [pitfalls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01653). Hence, we always first want to aggregate for each subject independently from each other and then across subjects. In the htc framework, the [`MetricAggregation`](../../htc/models/common/MetricAggregation.py) class is responsible for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we would like to have is a summary of our training run with nice visualizations for our scores which are aggregated while respecting the hierarchy in the data. Here, the general idea is to write one Jupyter Notebook which contains all these aggregations and visualizations for one training run and then use this as a template to generate it for every trained network. The notebook itself is highly task-specific but there are some notebook in this repository which you can use as reference. Especially for this tutorial, there is also a notebook in this folder which we now want to use. To use this as template for our training run, execute the following command:"
